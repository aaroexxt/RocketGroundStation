# RocketGroundStation

This software is designed to work with [Zenith](https://github.com/aaroexxt/TVCRocket), my thrust-vector controlled rocket project, for remote command and control of the vehicle.

### Features:

- (In testing) Real-time telemetry encryption (AES-256) for secure communications
- Graphing of vehicle parameters including position, velocity, and raw sensor data
- Vehicle connectivity tracking, signal strength indication
- Clear and prominent vehicle state indication
- Simple control panel with remote commands to send to vehicle
- (Todo) Waypoint plotting
